Crop Yield Prediction

Project Overview

Crop Yield Prediction is a machine learning-based project aimed at predicting crop yields based on various environmental and agricultural factors. This tool helps farmers, agriculturalists, and policymakers make data-driven decisions to enhance productivity and sustainability.



Features

Accurate Predictions: Leverages machine learning models to forecast crop yields.

Environmental Factor Analysis: Considers multiple variables like rainfall, temperature, soil type, and more.

Data Visualization: Provides intuitive charts and graphs to better understand trends and predictions.

Scalable: Designed to accommodate large datasets and multiple regions.

User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use frontend for non-technical users.


Installation

Prerequisites

Python (>= 3.8)

pip

A virtual environment tool like venv or conda

Steps

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crop-yield-prediction.git
cd crop-yield-prediction

Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the application:

python app.py

Usage

Prepare your dataset in CSV format with features like rainfall, temperature, soil pH, etc.

Upload the dataset via the application.

Choose the crop type and region for prediction.

View the prediction results and visualizations.

Technologies Used

Backend: Python, Flask/Django

Frontend: React.js/HTML & CSS (optional)

Machine Learning: scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Database: SQLite/PostgreSQL (optional for large datasets)

Dataset

You can use publicly available agricultural datasets from sources like:

Kaggle

FAO

ICRISAT

Ensure your dataset includes relevant features such as:

Rainfall

Temperature

Soil pH

Fertilizer usage

Crop type

Future Enhancements

Incorporate Satellite Data: Use remote sensing data for better predictions.

Real-time Predictions: Integrate IoT devices for live data inputs.

Multi-Crop Support: Expand predictions to support a wider variety of crops.

Mobile Application: Develop a mobile-friendly version.
