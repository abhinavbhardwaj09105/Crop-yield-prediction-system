Crop Yield Prediction

**Project Overview**

Crop Yield Prediction is a machine learning-based project aimed at predicting crop yields based on various environmental and agricultural factors. This tool helps farmers, agriculturalists, and policymakers make data-driven decisions to enhance productivity and sustainability.



**Features**

Accurate Predictions: Leverages machine learning models to forecast crop yields.

Environmental Factor Analysis: Considers multiple variables like rainfall, temperature, soil type, and more.

Data Visualization: Provides intuitive charts and graphs to better understand trends and predictions.

Scalable: Designed to accommodate large datasets and multiple regions.

User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use frontend for non-technical users.


Installation

Prerequisites
